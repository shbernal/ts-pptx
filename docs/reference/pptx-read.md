# Reading and round-tripping existing decks (`pptxgenjs/read`)

The `pptxgenjs/read` subpath opens an **existing** `.pptx` file, exposes its
OPC package structure, and saves it back losslessly. It is the foundation for
python-pptx-style editing of decks this library did not generate.

It is a separate subsystem from the generator (`pptxgenjs`) and the inspector
(`pptxgenjs/inspect`): those are one-way and lossy, while `read` keeps the
package's own XML as the source of truth.

Status: **Phase 1 — OPC layer**. Load, inspect parts/content types/
relationships, and save. Mutation happens directly on a part's DOM plus
`markDirty()`; typed editing APIs (`Presentation`, `Slide`, `TextFrame`, …)
come in later phases.

## Quick start

```js
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { OpcPackage } from '@shbernal/pptxgenjs/read'

const pkg = await OpcPackage.load(await readFile('deck.pptx'))

// Inspect the package
const slides = pkg.partsByContentType(
	'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.slide+xml'
)
console.log(slides.map((part) => part.partName)) // ['/ppt/slides/slide1.xml', ...]

// Save it back — untouched parts are byte-identical
await writeFile('deck-roundtrip.pptx', await pkg.save())
```

The module is isomorphic: bytes in, bytes out, no `node:fs`. File I/O is the
caller's job, so it works in browsers too.

## Fidelity contract

- A `Part` keeps the **original bytes** from the zip for its whole life.
- Accessing `part.dom` parses lazily; parsing alone changes nothing.
- `save()` writes original bytes for every part that was never marked dirty —
  **untouched part bodies are byte-identical** to the input.
- Dirty parts (after `part.markDirty()`) are reserialized from their DOM:
  semantically equivalent and schema-valid, but not byte-identical (attribute
  quoting and whitespace may differ). The XML declaration is preserved.
- Whole-zip byte-identity is **not** promised: zip metadata and compression
  may differ. The contract covers part bodies, the part-name set, and part
  order.

This is verified by `test/read/roundtrip.test.js` against PowerPoint-authored
fixtures (see `test/read/fixtures/README.md`).

## API

### `OpcPackage`

```ts
type OpcInput = string | number[] | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | Blob

class OpcPackage {
	static load(input: OpcInput): Promise<OpcPackage>

	/** All parts keyed by partname (e.g. '/ppt/slides/slide1.xml'), in zip order. */
	readonly parts: ReadonlyMap<string, Part>
	/** Content-type resolution overlay over [Content_Types].xml (read-only). */
	readonly contentTypes: ContentTypes

	part(partName: string): Part | undefined
	partsByContentType(contentType: string): Part[]
	/** Relationships owned by a part; '/' (default) = package-level /_rels/.rels. */
	relationshipsFor(sourcePartName?: string): Relationships

	save(): Promise<Uint8Array>
}
```

`load()` rejects when the input is not an OPC package or when a part has no
resolvable content type (no `Override`, no `Default`) — the error names the
offending part.

`[Content_Types].xml` is not enumerated in `parts`; it is managed by the
package and exposed through the `contentTypes` overlay.

### `Part`

```ts
class Part {
	readonly partName: string
	readonly contentType: string

	/** Original bytes from the package. Do not mutate. */
	readonly bytes: Uint8Array
	/** Whether the body is XML (by content type). */
	readonly isXmlPart: boolean
	/** True once the body has been materialized as a DOM. */
	readonly isParsed: boolean
	/** Lazily parsed DOM (throws for binary parts such as images). */
	readonly dom: Document

	/** Call after mutating the DOM so save() reserializes this part. */
	markDirty(): void
	readonly isDirty: boolean

	/** Original bytes when clean; serialized DOM when dirty. */
	serialize(): Uint8Array
}
```

The `Document` type is `@xmldom/xmldom`'s, not lib.dom's — they are not
assignable to each other.

### `ContentTypes`

Read-only overlay over `[Content_Types].xml`.

```ts
class ContentTypes {
	static parse(xml: string): ContentTypes
	/** Exact Override match first, else Default by lowercased extension. */
	contentTypeFor(partName: string): string | undefined
	serialize(): string
}
```

### `Relationships`

Read-only overlay over one `.rels` part. Iterable.

```ts
interface Relationship {
	id: string // 'rId1'
	type: string // relationship type URI
	target: string // as written: relative or absolute
	targetMode?: 'Internal' | 'External'
}

class Relationships {
	static parse(xml: string, sourcePartName: string): Relationships
	readonly sourcePartName: string
	readonly size: number
	get(id: string): Relationship | undefined
	byType(type: string): Relationship[]
	/** Absolute partname for an internal rel; throws for External rels. */
	resolveTarget(id: string): string
	serialize(): string
}
```

Relationship ids are opaque: numbering is not necessarily contiguous or
ordered.

### Partname helpers

```ts
/** OPC pack-URI resolution: relative target + owning part → absolute partname. */
function resolveRelativePartName(sourcePartName: string, target: string): string
/** '.rels' partname for a part; '/' → '/_rels/.rels'. */
function relsPartNameFor(sourcePartName: string): string
```

## Editing today (low-level)

Until the typed API lands, edits work directly on the DOM:

```js
const slide = pkg.part('/ppt/slides/slide1.xml')
const run = slide.dom.getElementsByTagName('a:t')[0]
run.textContent = 'New title'
slide.markDirty() // without this, save() writes the original bytes

const edited = await pkg.save()
```

Only the touched part is reserialized; everything else stays byte-identical.

## Testing

`pnpm run test:read` runs the round-trip harness (part-set stability,
byte-identity, laziness, idempotence, content-type/relationship resolution,
dirty-path, schema validation). Schema cases require the OOXML validator
(`./tools/ooxml-validator/install.sh`) and are skipped with a notice when it
is absent. See [testing](../testing.md).

Beyond the automated suite, `pnpm run test:read:emit` writes each fixture's
`load() → save()` output to `.tmp/roundtrip/` so it can be opened in PowerPoint
to confirm there is no repair prompt. As of 2026-06-13 this manual check has
passed on **PowerPoint for the web** for all four fixtures; the stricter
**desktop PowerPoint** check is still outstanding (tracked in
`test/read/fixtures/README.md`).
